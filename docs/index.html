            <p>
              Hello everyone! I am Dasha Tart - a personal stylist based in
              Sydney.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                I have been working in the fashion industry since July 2016;
              </li>
              <li>
                From August 2018 to April 2019 studied at the St. Petersburg’s
                school for personal and fashion stylists Style Profi;
              </li>
              <li>
                I love styling and helping women to solve their wardrobe
                problems and to develop their own style;
              </li>
              <li>
                I love to participate in projects and attend fashion events;
              </li>
              <li>
                In March 2019, took part as a volunteer stylist in organizing a
                fashion show with Elvigo Fashion at the business summit of the
                marketing agency 105 ideas;
              </li>
              <li>
                In May 2019, organized my own project Style Transformation,
                during which 4 specialists: a stylist, makeup artist,
                hairdresser and photographer created new everyday looks for
                three different women.
              </li>
              <li>
                Constantly learning new things and actively developing my own
                brand “Dasha Tart Stylist”.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I believe that style is not something that can be taken from the
              outside. It is something that already exists in each of us. This
              is our natural beauty, uniqueness, value. This is our personality,
              which is expressed through clothing. And on this you can work. To
              modify and boost your personal image - is one of the ways to
              transform your own life.
